                People in the southern hemisphere are upside down. Don't look at me like that. I can prove it!

                Go outside at night and look at the moon. You'll probably need a telescope for this, because you don't have eyes as good as mine. Look at the moon and take a picture if you can. Check out where the craters are. Now, go to Australia and do this again. Where are the craters?

                They're on the OPPOSITE SIDE, man! Because you're UPSIDE DOWN. And you have been since you crossed the equator. Now scoop up your brain matter and put it back in your head.
